    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong><em> The ingredients listed are for a serving size of 1.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 green onions, sliced on the bias</li>
      <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms (Optional)</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup cooked ham strips</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add green onions, mushrooms, and bell pepper; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in ham until heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and black pepper. Transfer to a small bowl; keep filling warm.</li>
      <li>Beat eggs together in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 teaspoon butter; heat until foaming. Pour in beaten eggs; cook for 30 seconds. Lift omelet edges so uncooked egg runs under cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move uncooked egg. Repeat until top is set, but still moist and soft, about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Arrange filling over one side of omelet; fold other half over filling. Slide omelet onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
