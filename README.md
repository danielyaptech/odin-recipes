# odin-recipes
In this project, I created a recipe website using HTML. This experience allowed me to showcase my skills in structuring a webpage with elements such as `<a>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and others.
I demonstrate how to link different webpages from an index page and navigate back to the main page from the subpages.
I demonstrate how to embed images into the webpages, resize them, and provide a title for each image that appears when the mouse cursor hovers over it.
I demonstrate how to use the <ul> and <ol> and <dl> elements for different types of lists.
